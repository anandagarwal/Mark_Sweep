1)enter 1st root node
2)enter child node
3)mention the parent
4)enter second root node
5)enter second child
5)mention the parent
now structure is created 

we have to input this as a file into our code
------------------------------------------------------------------
we can set choices that can be detected by the code as to which is the parent and which is the child.
suppose we set 'R'as root and 'C'as a child
eg.R 2
   R 3 this created 2 root nodes
now if we want to add a child to the a particular node
we mention its parent and the symbol 'C'
eg.'C'                               2             3
   (Symbol for child node)      (child value) (which parent you are adding it to)
